#### 3.1.2 Implementation Features
```python
def graph_A_star(start, goal, graph, heuristic):
    priority_queue = [(heuristic[start], 0, start)]
    came_from = {start: None}
    cost_so_far = {start: 0}
    visited = set()
    
    while priority_queue:
        _, current_cost, current = heappop(priority_queue)
        
        if current in visited:
            continue
        visited.add(current)
        
        if current == goal:
            return reconstruct_path(came_from, current), current_cost
        
        for neighbor, edge_cost in graph[current]:
            new_cost = current_cost + edge_cost
            if neighbor not in cost_so_far or new_cost < cost_so_far[neighbor]:
                cost_so_far[neighbor] = new_cost
                priority = new_cost + heuristic[neighbor]
                heappush(priority_queue, (priority, new_cost, neighbor))

        return values[node_index]
    
    if maximizing_player:
        max_eval = float('-inf')
        for i in range(2):  # Binary tree
            eval_score = alpha_beta(depth-1, False, alpha, beta, 
                                  node_index*2+i, values)
            max_eval = max(max_eval, eval_score)
            alpha = max(alpha, eval_score)
            if beta <= alpha:
                break  # Alpha-beta pruning
        return max_eval
    else:
        min_eval = float('inf')
        for i in range(2):
            eval_score = alpha_beta(depth-1, True, alpha, beta, 
                                  node_index*2+i, values)
            min_eval = min(min_eval, eval_score)
            beta = min(beta, eval_score)
            if beta <= alpha:
                break  # Alpha-beta pruning
        return min_eval
```
